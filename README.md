[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/cubismod/caddy-cf/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/cubismod/caddy-cf)

My **bespoke** build of Caddy including a few modules, see [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).
Named Cloudflare as it is focused around Cloudflare DNS based functionality.
